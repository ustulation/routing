- Bugfix to not reject BootstrapRequest messages invalidly.

## [0.32.2]
- Bugfix to avoid adding nodes to disconnected client list.

## [0.32.1]
- Bugfix to avoid handling recently-disconnected client direct messages.

## [0.32.0]
- Allow mock-crust network to support multiple nodes/clients with the same IPs.
- Allow only one client ip per proxy.
- Modify the client Rate Limiter paradigm to not put an upper threshold on number of clients with unique IPs to bootstrap off a proxy.
- Add dev configuration options for routing such that these options can be supplied in a routing config file that routing would read to tweak parameters such as disable resource proof etc.
- Update to use Rust Stable 1.19.0 / Nightly 2017-07-20, clippy 0.0.144, and rustfmt 0.9.0.
- Make MutableData errors more descriptive.

## [0.31.0]
- Remove support for Structured, PrivAppendable and PubAppendable Data
- Add Support for MutableData instead.
- Introduce mock-crypto which provides efficient mocking of the crypto primitives for faster test runs for cases where we don't care about tightness of security.
- Code rate-limiter to restrict proxy from relaying more than the agreed threshold to the Network on behalf of the clients (each client being identified on IP level).
- Detect malformed messages and invalid/disallowed RPCs and ban such a sender on IP level.

## [0.30.0]
- Replace all sha256 from rust_sodium with sha3_256 from tiny_keccak.
- Move `AccountPacket` type required by vaults and clients into a `common_types` module.

## [0.29.0]
- Integration with templatised Crust where now routing specifies what to use as a UID so that crust and routing use a common UID to identify peer.
- Peer manager clean up as connect success now tells us everything about the peer. Previously we needed to wait additionally for NodeIdentify for instance as crust-uid (PeerId) and routing-uid (PublicId) were separate and each layer informed about the id specific to that layer only.

## [0.28.5]
- Add section update requests to make merges more stable.
- Don't approve new node if routing table is invalid.
- Work around cases where `OtherSectionMerge` would not accumulate.
- Several fixes to tunnel nodes and peer manager.
- Remove more sources of randomness to make tests deterministic.
- Add new error types related to invitation-based account creation.
- Replace rustc-serialize with serde.

## [0.28.4]
- Don't try to reconnect to candidates that are not yet approved.
- Don't include peers in `sent_to` that are not directly connected.
- Use SHA3 everywhere instead of SipHash.
- `PrefixSection` authorities now always refer to all sections _compatible_
  with the given prefix.
- Cache `OwnSectionMerge` messages until both merging sections have sent one.
  Only then update the routing table.
- Cache any routing table updates while merging, and relay them afterwards.
- Other merge and tunnel fixes, and additional tests for merging and tunnels.
- Try to reconnect after a connection drops.

## [0.28.2]
- Extend the tests for tunnelling and the churn tests.
- Fix several peer manager issues related to tunnel nodes and candidates.
- Send `SectionSplit` messages as `PrefixSection` authority to allow resending.
- Fix several issues related to merging sections.
- Some improvements to the log messages.

## [0.28.1]
- Retry preparing connection info if Crust returns an error.

## [0.28.0]
- Profile the bandwidth of nodes joining the network. Reject slow nodes.
- Organise nodes into disjoint sections. Introduce the `Section` and
  `PrefixSection` authorities.
- Maintain lists of signatures of neighbouring sections, which will enable
  secure  message validation.
- Accumulate messages in the sending group/section, then send the messages with
  all the signatures across a single route. This reduces the number of total
  invididual hop messages that need to be sent.
- Routes are now disjoint: Retrying to send a message along a different route
  cannot potentially fail on the same node again.
- Merge the routing_table crate into routing.
- Remove the internal event handling thread. Events should be handled in the
  upper library's event loop. That way, some message passing can be replaced by
  direct calls to routing methods.
- Remove the `PlainData` type which was only used in tests.

## [0.27.1]
- Increase the ID size limit by 10 kB.

## [0.27.0]

- support new deletion paradigm for structured data

## [0.26.0]

  into the peer manager module.
- Several bug fixes and test improvements.

## [0.24.2]
- Refactoring: Turn `Core` into a state machine with `Client` and `Node` states.
  Move some more logic onto the `PeerManager`.
- Fix a bug that caused some nodes to refuse to close an unneeded connection.

## [0.24.1]
- Fix redundant calls to Crust `connect`.

## [0.24.0]
- Fix sodiumoxide to v0.0.10 as the new released v0.0.12 does not support
  rustc-serializable types anymore and breaks builds.
- Avoid redundant hash calculations by making the data `name` method a simple
  getter.
- Fix ack handling when resending a message.
- Some refactoring and test updates.

## [0.23.2]
- Don't cache as a member of recipient group: this can cause redundant
  responses.

- Reduce the `XorName` size from 512 to 256 bits.

## [0.20.0]
- Send acknowledgement messages (acks) and resend via a different route only if
  no ack is received. Previously, several routes were used simultaneously,
  wasting a lot of bandwidth.
- Merge xor_name into routing.
- Simplify the message type hierarchy and the API.
- Fix sending redundant connection info.

## [0.19.1]
- network size < GROUP_SIZE will only accept new nodes via first node
